## 🚀 Core Features

- **One-click MCP Deployment**  
  Automatically transforms any GitHub MCP Repo into a production-ready MCP Server with minimal setup.

- **Seamless Integration with AI Clients**  
  Compatible with MCP-enabled clients like **Cursor**, **Claude**, and other emerging AI Agents — just plug in the URL to start using.

- **GitHub-based Discovery Engine**  
  Leverages advanced GitHub analytics to identify and surface high-quality MCP Repos from the open-source community.

- **Revenue Sharing for Developers**  
  Developers can log in with GitHub and instantly **claim earnings** generated from their MCPs.

- **Developer-Friendly by Design**  
  No infrastructure required. You build the logic — we handle **hosting, deployment, and monetization**.

  Each MCP acts as a plug-and-play function in a global agent economy — **turning tools into digital assets**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
MCPForge delivers an all-in-one cloud hosting solution for MCP Servers, enabling cryptocurrency payments to smart contracts while automatically provisioning dedicated instances for users. MCP Client requests are routed through a global load-balancing gateway to containerized MCP servers, with proxy services facilitating communication via standard input/output (stdio) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocols.
